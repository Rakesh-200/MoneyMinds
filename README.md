# MoneyMinds Atm-System
In this project, I have demonstrated the working functionality of an ATM Machine Software customised according to my SPMP and SRS.
There are two basic sections:
(1)User: This panel is for normal users who can perform the following functions from an ATM:
		(1.1)Deposit Money
		(1.2)Balance Transfer
		(1.3)Change PIN
		(1.4)Withdraw Money
		(1.5)Check Balance
(2)Admin: This panel is for the professionals associated with the bank and for the machine administrator.He can perform actions like:
		(2.1)Add new user/customer
		(2.2)Remove user from the database.
